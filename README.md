bgp-reports
===========

Script used to extract information from BGP dumps

This is currently beta software. Do not use it without asking for some help.

What do you need to get these scripts working:

1) A copy of the BGP global table and (at least) one BGP table from an IXP, 
   in either of these formats:
    * Cisco/Quagga 'show ip bgp' or 'show ip bgp neighbor w.x.y.z received-routes' 
        obtained from any looking glass you like, for example:
        http://www-01.pch.net/resources/data/routing-tables/archive/
    * RIPE NCC's MRT Format obtained from: 
        http://www.ripe.net/data-tools/stats/ris/ris-raw-data

2) We are working on this file too...
